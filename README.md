# Android Malware Detection Using Genetic Algorithm-based Optimized Feature Selection and Deep Learning

This project aims to develop a robust Android malware detection system utilizing Genetic Algorithm-based optimized feature selection coupled with Deep Learning techniques.

## Overview

Android malware poses a significant threat to mobile device security. This project addresses this issue by employing a multi-stage approach:

1. **Feature Extraction**: Relevant features are extracted from Android apps, capturing crucial characteristics indicative of malware behavior.

2. **Feature Selection Optimization**: Genetic Algorithms (GA) are utilized to optimize feature selection, enhancing the effectiveness of the detection system.

3. **Deep Learning Model Development**: A Deep Learning model, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), is trained on the selected features to accurately classify apps as either benign or malicious.

4. **Validation and Optimization**: The model undergoes rigorous validation and optimization processes, including data splitting, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation, to ensure its effectiveness and generalizability.

## Key Features

- Integration of Genetic Algorithm-based feature selection for improved malware detection accuracy.
